# CS-110
The most notable projects (and necessary libraries) from my Python class at Hamilton.

## Pulsar
This project required the analysis of pulsar data from the ATNF pulsar catalog (https://www.atnf.csiro.au), in
hopes of understanding pulsars in the ”vicinity” of earth. The data were contained in a CSV, and our task was to parse the data appropriately and run experiments that print superlatives (such as oldest, closest, and most recently discovered) to the console as well as all of the data associated with that pulsar. Testing is accomlished in the file testing_pulsar.py

## Tiling
A tetris-style tiling game (written using turtle) where the goal is to use "triominoes" to populate a grid. Pressing "t" creates a triomino, "r" rotates it, and movement in two dimensions is controlled via the arrow keys.

## The Game (Lost Cities)
The final project of CS-110. Using a graphics library [created specifically for CS-110 at Hamilton](https://github.com/matthewjenkins97/CS110-Graphics), I recreated the game Lost Cities, [whose rules can be found here](https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/c8/66/47-lost-cities-rulebook.pdf).
